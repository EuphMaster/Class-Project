Class Project Step 3      Jason Morgan     26 August 2018


Good afternoon.  My name is Jason Morgan and I am currently participating in the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy. At Ft Bragg NC, August through December 2018.

My Project will be an organization system.  The purpose of this software is to provide information to the public as well as collect information for the sites administrator.  It will be simple, easy to use, and easy to read.

Thank you for your time.
